##Purpose
This project was meant to show case our best work thus far in our blossoming career. Partially by creating a website which in of itself highlights our skills but also points to various projects that highlight our skills in various ways.

##Project Experience
This project took some time as I am still learning how to write CSS. I had a lot fun putting this together and seeing what is possible out there. I believe this is a good starting point for showcasing my new set of coding skills. However I look forward to updating this as I grow as a developer.
